# Webhook

Welcome to my ModuleScript, which allows you to use your Webhooks in Roblox in a fast and easy way!

Give your users a unique experience by having your game make requests to third-party servers and apis!

# Why this ModuleScript?

I have made this ModuleScript to help those people who do not know how to use webhooks in Roblox, and also for all those people who are too lazy to write the code to send the webhook.

**The benefits of using this ModuleScript are the following:**

-   It helps you reduce code
-   It is easy to learn and use
-   Asynchronous

I have also made this ModuleScript for those people who want to make a simple but functional reporting system, because with this ModuleScript it will be easier for you!

> :warning: The use of this ModuleScript depends a lot on you and what you are looking for, I'm not a professional doing this, I'm just a common user in Roblox who wants to help the community, remember that there are always better options for this kind of ModuleScripts. If you decide to use this ModuleScript, I can only say thank you! :warning:

# Can it be used for any Webhook?

I did this initially to work with `Discord webhooks`, since they are the most commonly used in Roblox, it is likely that in the future I will adapt this modulescript to other types of webhooks.
