If you don't want to use them, you can set the <code>webhook_promises</code> property of <code>Settings.lua</code> to false, this way the code will run synchronously!</p>"},{"location":"Tutorial/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>If you are using ROJO in your project, you must download the repository at Webhook Releases, once you have done it, you will have to find the \"Webhook\" folder inside <code>src/server</code> and put it inside your project</p> <p>In case you are using Roblox Studio, you can download the <code>.rbxm</code> file from Webhook Releases, you can also get it from the Roblox <code>Marketplace</code> with this link: Webhook - Roblox</p> <p> Remember to place ModuleScript inside <code>ServerScriptService</code> </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Tutorial/#learning-to-use-webhook","title":"Learning to use Webhook","text":"<p>I recommend creating a Webhook instance for each webhook you have in use in your game, so you can have a better order and avoid having to copy and paste the same link for each function you use.</p> <p>Since we are talking about instances, let's learn how to create Webhook instances!</p>"},{"location":"Tutorial/#create-webhook-instances","title":"Create Webhook instances","text":"<p>First and most obvious of all, you need to call the module script in your code like this:</p> <pre><code>local Webhook = require(game.ServerScriptService.Webhook)\n</code></pre> <p>Once you do this, you must create an instance like this:</p> <pre><code>local reportWebhook = Webhook.new(\"your-webhook-url\")\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>.new</code> constructor receives 1 parameter -&gt; <code>webhookUrl: string</code>: The URL of the webhook you want to use</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Tutorial/#sending-simple-messages-to-your-webhook","title":"Sending simple messages to your webhook","text":"<p>Congratulations!
